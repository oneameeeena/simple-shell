Our simple shell script is designed to provide users with a basic command-line interface. Upon execution, the script displays a prompt, inviting the user to input commands. It then reads and executes each command entered by the user, mimicking the behavior of a standard shell. The script includes a mechanism to handle the 'exit' command, allowing users to gracefully exit the shell when desired. While limited in functionality compared to more sophisticated shells, our script serves as a fundamental tool for executing commands and interacting with the system in a straightforward manner.
